# Command-Line-Minesweeper

This was a quick project to set up an easy interface to create minesweeper AIs. This barebones version of minesweeper allows java
based bots to access data easily without DLL injections.

Bots can be created along side the source code, and can call the field utils functions to receive data from the game, as well as
display data to the user.
